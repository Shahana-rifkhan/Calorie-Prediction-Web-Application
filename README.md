# Calorie-Prediction-Web-Application
A Comprehensive Web-Based System for Calorie Prediction and Dynamic Workout Intensity Adjustment using Adaptive Reinforcement Learning. The proposed solution involves the development of a web application enhanced by machine learning algorithms to more accurately determine total calorie expenditure post-activity, tailored to individual users. This advanced system will not only facilitate calorie tracking but also generate comprehensive summaries of dietary intake and energy expenditure.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Reminders:** Users will receive reminders to monitor their calorie intake, helping them adhere to dietary goals.
- **Timely Feedback:** Incorporating variables such as post-workout timing, the system will provide timely feedback and support, encouraging a proactive approach to dietary management.

By achieving these objectives, the envisioned web application aims to provide a user-friendly, reliable, and intelligent platform for calorie tracking and dietary management. The integration of machine learning algorithms represents a significant advancement, enabling the system to adapt and optimize its functionalities based on user data and feedback.

## Functional Requirements

- **User Authentication:**
  - Registered users should be able to create a profile on the system and get user authentication to access the calorie estimation tool.
  
- **Calorie Prediction Algorithm:**
  - The system must have a calorie prediction algorithm that estimates the number of calories burned based on the user's exercise data, including duration, intensity, and heart rate.
  
- **Customized Recommendations (Reminders):**
  - Based on the user's goals and exercise data, the system should make personalized recommendations, such as advising them to follow a specific training regimen or reduce their calorie intake.
  
- **Data Visualization (Generate Reports):**
  - To help users comprehend their daily physical activity and calorie burn over time, the system should offer simple and interactive data visualizations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy:**
  - The system should offer precise calorie estimations with a small margin of error based on the user's exercise data.
  
- **Reliability:**
  - The system should be dependable with minimal downtime and maintenance requirements to guarantee continual access for users.
  
- **Security:**
  - The system must include robust security mechanisms to safeguard user data, such as user authentication and personal data encryption.
  
- **Usability:**
  - Users should be able to easily use the system and have access to clear instructions and user-friendly interfaces.
  
- **Scalability:**
  - The system should be scalable to support a high number of users and an increasing volume of data as the user base expands over time.
  
- **Performance:**
  - The system should respond promptly and load pages quickly, even during times of high demand.

## Hardware Requirements
